Add a objectid to the job table

Then add a constraint of unique(tasktype, objectid)

This will prevent, e.g double queueing of thumbnail creation tasks and so forth by passing the uploadid
as the object id


Add a Sha1HashGenerationTask and hashsha1 column to uploads, this should sha1 hash the file and store hte result

then add a cli task to queue a job for every single upload that doesn't have a sha1 hash

this will set the basis for a switch from md5 to sha1 hashing going forward

waht to do on conflicts? (should be impossible in theory... but practice always beats theory up)
